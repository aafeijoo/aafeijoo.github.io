As part of my work at [Signal Software](http://www.signalsoftware.es), I've colaborated in the development of a great system to generate virtual terrains to be used in professional flight simulators.

The system consists of a GIS application that allows the edition of georeferenced files (raster and vector), and the generation using these files of databases with real terrains: elevations, normals, textures, infrared, radar, etc.
